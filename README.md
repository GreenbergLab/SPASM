This repository contains **SPASM** (Software for Precise Analysis of Single Molecules) and accompanying files referenced in "Computational Tool for Ensemble Averaging of Single-Molecule Data." Thomas J. Blackwell, W. Tom Stump, Sarah R. Clippinger, and Michael J. Greenberg https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.241752v1.

**SPASM** is a MATLAB-based computational tool for generating ensemble averages of single-molecule data.

You can download **SPASM**, **SPASM_one_bead**, compiled versions of either program (for Windows or macOS), our program for generating simulated data, the user guide, and the data referenced in the paper [here](https://github.com/GreenbergLab/SPASM/releases/tag/v1.0).
